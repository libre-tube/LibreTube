About
</h2>

YouTube has an extremely invasive [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10364219) which relies on using user data in unethical ways. They store a lot of your personal data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.

This project is aimed at improving the users' privacy by being independent from Google and bypassing their data collection.

Therefore, the app is using the [Piped API](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped), which uses proxies to circumvent Google's data collection and includes some other additional features.

You can disable the Piped API by selecting "Full Local Mode". This way you can get the data directly (no proxy) from the [NewPipe Extractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor). Privacy and account-free video playback, local subscriptions, local playlist are available.

If you have questions or need help, please make sure to read the [FAQ](https://libre-tube.github.io/#faq) before asking for help at the community channels. The [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#LibreTube:matrix.org) is considered as the main communication channel, all other forums or social media accounts are maintained by volunteers from the community but not the developer(s).

LibreTube is customizable
</h2>


LibreTube can be used with your custom or existing Piped (API) instances, depending on your preference. However, you may experience playback issues. Instances can be blocked. They weaken due to high usage. This prevents Google servers from accessing your IP address or any other personal data.
Apart from that, Piped allows syncing your subscriptions between LibreTube and Piped, which can be used on desktop too.If the NewPipeExtractor breaks, it only requires an update of Piped and not LibreTube itself. Therefore, fixes usually arrive faster than in NewPipe

Optionally, you can completely disable the Piped API with the "Full Local Mode" option and get all data directly (no proxy) from NewPipe Extractor. You get more stability 

</sub>
‚ùìÔ∏èDifferences to NewPipe
</h2>


While LibreTube only supports YouTube, NewPipe also allows the use of other platforms like SoundCloud, PeerTube, Bandcamp and media.ccc.de.<br>
Both are great clients for watching YouTube videos. It depends on the individual's use case which one fits their needs better.
